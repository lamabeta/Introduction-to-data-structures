# The Relationship Between Data Structures and Algorithms
`Data structures` provide a way to **organize** and **store** data, while `algorithms` define the **step-by-step procedures** for solving specific problems or performing computational tasks on this data. 

## Concept 
The **choice** of an appropriate **data structure** can greatly **influence** the **efficiency of an algorithm**, and similarly, 
the selection of an **efficient algorithm** **relies on** the underlying **data structure**.

When designing algorithms, the choice of a data structure is crucial. An `algorithm's efficiency`often **depends on** how well the `chosen data structure` **supports** the required **operations**. Conversely, choosing an inefficient data structure for a particular algorithm can lead to poor performance.

## Example
- A graph traversal algorithm may require a graph data structure to accurately represent the relationships between elements.
- If an algorithm needs to frequently search for elements, selecting a data structure with efficient search capabilities, such as a binary search tree or hash table, can significantly improve the algorithm's runtime.
