# Data Structure Classification
Different types of data structures differ based on the operations you can perform on them and the efficiency of these operations.

## Concept
Data structures can be classified into **two** main **categories**: 
1. **linear data structures**, where 
> **elements** are **organized sequentially**. Each element has the **successors** and **predecessors** except the first and last element.

2. Non Linear data structures where
> **elements** are **organized hierarchically**, in a tree-like structure with **parent-child relationships**.

## Example
- Types of linear data structures are:
```
Arrays
Linked List
Stack
Queue
```
- Types of non linear data structures are:
```
   Trees
   Graphs
```
