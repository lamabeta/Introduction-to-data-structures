# Introduction to Data Structures Project 

### Objective
In this project, our main goal will be understanding the fundamentals of data structures.

### Concepts
The project solution heavily relies on these concepts as they form the core foundation. If any of these concepts are unfamiliar to you, we recommend referring to the provided resources for better understanding

| Concept | Resources |
| --- | ----------- |
| What is a Data Structure | [Data Structure Concept](https://github.com/lamabeta/Introduction-to-data-structures/blob/main/resources/01-what-is-a-data-structure.md) |
| Data Structure Classification | [Data Structure Classification Concept](https://github.com/lamabeta/Introduction-to-data-structures/blob/main/resources/02-data-structure-classification.md)|
| Operations on Data Structure| [Operations on Data Structure Concept](https://github.com/lamabeta/Introduction-to-data-structures/blob/main/resources/03-operations-on-data-structure.md) |


### Problem
Develope a new implementation for a given method by using the concepts of Data Structure.

### Implementation
Update the following code that store and print list of names by using a better approach based on what you learned from data sctructure concepts.([add your code here](https://github.com/lamabeta/Introduction-to-data-structures/blob/main/StudentsName.java))
```java
public class StudentsName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String firstStudent = "Nadaa";
        String secondStudent = "Lana";
        String thirdStudent = "Emman";
        String fourthStudent = "Amal";
        String fifthStudent = "Manal";
        String sixthStudent = "Fahad";
        String seventhStudent = "Ahmad";
        String eighthStudent = "Dana";
        String ninthStudent = "Reem";
        String tenthStudent = "Dalal";
        
        System.out.println("student name: " + firstStudent);
        System.out.println("student name: " + secondStudent);
        System.out.println("student name: " + thirdStudent);
        System.out.println("student name: " + fourthStudent);
        System.out.println("student name: " + fifthStudent);
        System.out.println("student name: " + sixthStudent);
        System.out.println("student name: " + seventhStudent);
        System.out.println("student name: " + eighthStudent);
        System.out.println("student name: " + ninthStudent);
        System.out.println("student name: " + tenthStudent);
    }
}
```
